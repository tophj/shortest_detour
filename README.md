## Shortest Detour

Programming Challenge from lyft.com :

"Calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude / longitude 
pairs, where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from 
point C to point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the 
detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver."


Correct usage: 'python shortest_detour.py latt1 long1 latt2 long2 latt3 long3 latt4 long4'
Where latt = Lattitude and long = Longitude


ex. 'python shortest_detour.py 38.527618 -76.146819 37.421995 -122.084005 37.331741 -122.030333 37.783951 -122.407162'


Return: None

Prints out the correct response.
